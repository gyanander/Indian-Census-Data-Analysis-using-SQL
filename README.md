  # Indian-Census 2011-Data-Analysis-using-SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Indian Census data using SQL Server to extract meaningful insights into 
population ditribution,literacy rate,growth rate and sex ratio across states and districts.
it demonstrates practical SQL skills applied in real world data analysis.

## Key SQL skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning and Validation
- Aggregate Functions(SUM,AVG,COUNT)
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- JOINS
- Window Functions(RANK,DENSE_RANK,NTILE)
- Common Table Expressions(CTE)
- CASE Statements
- Views and Subqueries

## Key Analysis Performed
- Performed demographics analysis on 600+ districts across Indian states using SQL Server
- Derived key state-level KPIs including literacy rate,sex ratio  ,population growth % and total population.
- Utilized advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs,Window Functions(RANK,DENSE_RANK,NTILE).
- Built reusable SQL views for efficient state_wise population aggregation.
- Conduct data validation to identity to identify NULL values,duplicates and ensure data consistency.
- Developed literacy performance bands using CASE statements for actionable categorical insights.

## Sample Insights
- Kerala has the highest literacy rate at 93.9% among Indian states.
- Bihar has one of the lowest literacy rates among major states.
- States with higher literacy rates generally  show better gender ratios.
- Uttar Pradesh has the highest population among all states.
- Smaller states like Sikkim and Goa show better literacy performance despite lower population.
- District-level analysis shows significant variation in literacy within the same state.
- Southern States perform better on literacy and gender ratio compared to northen states.
- Some Districts show high population growth but lower literacy improvement.
- Unban-dominated districts tend to have higher literacy rates.
- Literacy performance bands created using CASE statements help categorize states into High,Medium and low literacy groups.
